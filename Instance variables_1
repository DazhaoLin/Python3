############# Notes ################
exampleObject3 has been enriched with a property named third just on the fly, outside the class's code - this is possible and fully permissible.

Python objects, when created, are gifted with a small set of predefined properties and methods. Each object has got them, whether you want them or not. 
One of them is a variable named __dict__ (it's a dictionary).
