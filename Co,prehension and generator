################### Notes ############################
看好第一个是中括号，第二个是小括号  The brackets make a comprehension, the parentheses make a generator.
'generator' has no len()

Note: the same appearance of the output doesn't mean that both loops work in the same way. 
In the first loop, the list is created (and iterated through) as a whole - it actually exists when the loop is being executed.

In the second loop, there is no list at all - there are only subsequent values produced by the generator, one by one.
