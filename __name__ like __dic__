__dict__ is a dictionary. Another built-in property worth mentioning is __name__, which is a string.

The property contains the name of the class. It's nothing exciting, just a string.

Note: the __name__ attribute is absent from the object - it exists only inside classes.

If you want to find the class of a particular object, you can use a function named type(), which is able (among other things) to find a class which has been used to instantiate any object.

class Classy:
    pass

print(Classy.__name__)
obj = Classy()
print(type(obj).__name__)

############### Output ################
Classy
Classy
#######################################

Note: a statement like this one:

print(obj.__name__) will cause an error.
